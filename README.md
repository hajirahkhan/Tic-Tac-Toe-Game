# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A tic tac toe game which allows a Human Player to play against a Robot player and determine's a winner once the game has finished or indicates when there is a tie. 

This project was created using concepts of data structures which allowed the game to take place. The Tic Tac Toe game board is represented by a two-dimensional array, each move correlates to the corresponding position on the tic tac toe board. Once three positions in the two-dimensional array are populated with the same value (an X or an O) and indicate three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally a winner is declared or if all the positions are populated without a winner the game is declared a draw. This project allowed me to understand how data structures apply on real world applications and the practicality of data structures behind the scenes of various applications. Below a demo is attached of how the Tic Tac Toe game functioned. The demo shows how the game prevents a human player from making a move in a position which is already occupied, it also shows how the Robot player makes a choice from all the possible moves and it also illustrates how the game determines a winner or loser.
